# Full-Stack Developer Journey 2026 🚀

Welcome to the central hub of my full-stack development adventure!  
This repo is my **learning-in-public** space where I document **every step**, every project, every line of code, and every breakthrough as I go from beginner experiments to building real, deployable full-stack applications.

### My Story So Far
After playing around with **AI-assisted coding** tools (Replit, Google AI Studio, Antigravity vibes), I built some fun websites locally and even deployed one:  
🌐 **Live Example**: [KwiqRent – Quick Rental Prototype](https://kwiqrent.onrender.com/)

Now I'm leveling up properly with structured learning on **freeCodeCamp's Full Stack Developer Certification** — mastering fundamentals, modern tools, and best practices the right way.

### Current Focus / Tech Stack I'm Exploring
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript → React / Next.js + TypeScript  
- **Backend**: Node.js, APIs, databases (Supabase/Postgres love!)  
- **Tools & Vibes**: Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Git/GitHub, Replit for quick prototypes, AI for brainstorming  
- **Learning Path**: freeCodeCamp projects → personal builds → full apps with auth, realtime, deployment

### What's Inside This Repo
- `/projects/` → All my completed & in-progress apps (with live demos where possible)  
- `/learning-notes/` → Daily/weekly notes, code snippets, challenges solved  
- `/freeCodeCamp/` → Certifications progress, solutions, reflections  
- `/experiments/` → Wild AI-assisted ideas & fun side stuff
